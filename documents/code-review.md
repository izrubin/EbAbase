I reviewed the following projects:
+ [Public Transportation Ridership and Climate Data, by Chloe Hacker](https://github.com/chloehacker/public-transportation-ridership-and-climate-data)
+ [Resistance map of the genomic structure of long-tail salamanders, by Neha Savant](https://github.com/nehasavant/PDSB-Project)
+ [Web scraping for habitat fragmentation and loss, by Vijay Ramesh](https://github.com/vjjan91/PDSB-project)

1. In reviewing your peer's projects did you find that their README files made it clear what their project is, how to install it, and how to use it? Do you think that your README file does a good job at this?
+ Chloe: Yes, her README file is clear on all points.
+ Neha: Her README files includes a description of the project and her plans to develop it, but do not include installation or usage instructions.
+ Vijay: His README includes a thorough project description and brief explanation of what each folder in the repo is for, but does not include installation instructions.

2. Did your peer have Python scripts in a directory named project, and were you able to understand the structure of the python scripts?
+ Chloe: There are no Python scripts in her project directory.
+ Neha: No, she does not.
+ Vijay: No, he does not.

3. Did your peer provide example notebooks in the notebooks directory? Does the README file link to, or tell you about the example notebooks? Were you able to understand from the example notebooks how to use the code, or what your peer is trying to solve in the notebook?
+ Chloe: Yes.
+ Neha: She has one notebook with some code to use in a terminal, but not much so far.
+ Vijay: He does have example notebooks with fairly clear explanations and code, which are mentioned in the README.

4. Did you come up with any ideas for improving your own project by reviewing your peer's project directories?
+ I could link directly to and explain my notebooks and project in greater detail in my README file, and develop my own project much more overall.
