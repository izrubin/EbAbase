# EbAbase

## Project Description
EbAbase is a final project developed during the Programming & Data Science Skills course to create a package for scraping the web for international aid project information and returning that in formatted dataframes. EbAbase is specifically focused on gathering project information from multiple sources (USAID, UNDP, and more) in order to build a database of mountain Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) projects, with potential for wider application in querying and return project data fitting other search parameters.
